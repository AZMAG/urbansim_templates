Data I/O template APIs
======================

Data i/o templates let you set up automated model steps for loading data into Orca or saving outputs to disk. 

These templates follow the same principles as the statistical model steps. For example, to set up a data table, create an instance of the ``TableFromDisk`` class and set some properties: the table name, file type, path, and anything else that's needed. 

Registering this object with ModelManager will save it to disk as a yaml file, and create an Orca step with instructions to set up the table. "Running" the object/step registers the table with Orca, but doesn't read the data from disk yet â€” Orca loads data lazily as it's needed.

Data registration steps are run automatically when you initialize ModelManager.
